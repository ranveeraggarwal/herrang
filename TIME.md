# Time, in full

`src/lib/herrang/time.ts` is the source of truth — this file is the
assumptions behind it written out, so they're findable instead of
re-derived (or re-broken) every time someone touches a date. If you're
about to edit anything involving a clock, a class time, or a date string,
read this first.

## The core assumption: the camp day doesn't end at midnight

It ends when the DJs stop, somewhere around 04:00. Everything below exists
to make that true in code without turning every comparison into a
timezone-aware mess.

## The three clocks

- **Day** 08:00–19:10 — classes.
- **Night** 19:10–04:00 — the party. Covers both "just after the last
  class" (19:10–23:59) and the post-midnight tail (00:00–03:59).
- **Weird hours** 04:00–08:00 — one "go to bed" card. Nothing is
  scheduled; this is the dead zone between the party ending and the next
  day's classes.

`modeFor(minutes)` computes this from **raw wall-clock minutes** and the
boundaries are half-open with no gaps: `[480,1150)` day, `[1150,1440) ∪
[0,240)` night, `[240,480)` weird.

## Poster dates

A poster (the physical thing pinned up at camp, one per day) covers
**08:00 → 07:59 the next morning**. A time printed on a poster after
midnight — e.g. "02:00" on Saturday's poster, meaning the party runs into
Sunday morning — is **stored exactly as printed** ("02:00") but that
instant is really on the *next calendar day*.

- `clock.posterDate`: which poster is in force right now. Before 08:00,
  you're still on yesterday's poster.
- `clock.dateISO`: the real calendar date. Used anywhere the UI needs to
  answer "what day is it" without looking stuck during the 04:00–08:00
  tail (the header, mainly).

Never invent `25:00`/`26:00`-style notation or ISO datetimes in data
files. Times are always plain `HH:MM` as printed on the poster.

## Two flavors of minutes — this is the whole game

- **`toMinutes(hhmm)`** — minutes since local midnight. Resets to 0 at
  midnight, same as a naive `getHours()*60+getMinutes()`.
- **`toPosterMinutes(hhmm)`** — minutes since 08:00 of the poster date.
  Times before 08:00 get +1440 added, so they land *after* the day's
  daytime hours instead of wrapping back to near-zero. This makes
  cross-midnight ordering an ordinary `<`/`>=` comparison.
- **`clock.minutes`** — raw wall-clock (mirrors `toMinutes`).
- **`clock.posterMinutes`** — continuous across midnight (mirrors
  `toPosterMinutes`).

**Rule: any comparison against a class, special, or event time uses the
poster-timeline pair (`toPosterMinutes` / `clock.posterMinutes`), never
the raw pair.** The raw pair exists for exactly two legitimate uses,
both of which want the *actual* clock, not the poster-shifted one:

- `isNightGround(clock.minutes)` — the day/night ground color follows
  the real clock (20:00–08:00), independent of which poster is showing.
- `clock.dateISO` — the header's "what day is it" line.

Everything else — `nowAndNextClass`, `isWeekWrapped`, `isPast`,
`relativeChip`, `endsChip`, the finished-item dimming in `TodayView` and
`WeekView`, the running/elapsed math in `TonightView` — takes poster
minutes. Passing the wrong flavor is a real bug, not a style nit: raw
minutes reset to a small number right after midnight, so a class that
ended 8 hours ago reads as numerically "in the future." This has already
happened twice (see git history around "day-end-assumptions-timing") —
once in `TodayView`/`WeekView`, once in `schedule.ts`.

There's no type-level guard against this today (the two flavors are both
plain `number`). That's a known soft spot, not a design endorsement — see
the code review from the timing fix for the branded-type option, deferred
as a separate decision.

## The data invariant everything quietly leans on

Class (`WeekClass`) and week-special (`WeekSpecial`) times are always in
the 08:00–19:10 daytime window — nothing in the master schedule crosses
midnight. `toMinutes(x) === toPosterMinutes(x)` for all of them today,
which is *why* code that (mistakenly) used raw minutes against class
times still mostly worked. Only `DailyEvent` (the nightly program — DJs,
shows, socials) genuinely has after-midnight entries, and only that path
was originally written with `toPosterMinutes` from the start.

If an after-midnight whole-camp special is ever ingested into
`week.specials`, this invariant breaks — but the comparisons have since
been switched to `toPosterMinutes` throughout, so it'll be handled
correctly rather than silently misdimmed.

## Timezone: assumed, not computed

Europe/Stockholm is assumed equal to device time. There is no runtime
timezone math anywhere in the page — `new Date()`, `getHours()`,
`getMinutes()` are read as-is. This is a deliberate simplification, not
an oversight: the app is only ever used at camp, on a device already set
to local time.

**The one exception is the ICS subscription feed** (`src/lib/herrang/ical.ts`,
`src/lib/ical.ts`): it emits real `DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Stockholm` values
with a proper `VTIMEZONE` block (CET/CEST `RRULE`s), because a calendar
subscriber might be reading it from anywhere, at any time of year. It
only ever iterates `week.classes` and `week.specials` — both daytime — so
it never has to reason about the poster-date midnight shift. If a night
program event were ever exported, it would need `posterDate + 1` handling
that doesn't exist yet.

## DST doesn't come up, on purpose

Camp runs in July; Sweden's DST switches happen in late March and late
October, so no transition ever occurs mid-camp. Two things keep this from
ever mattering even off-season:

- Date-string stepping (`src/lib/dates.ts`: `addDays`, `diffDays`,
  `formatCompactWeekdayDate`) is done via `setUTCDate`/`getUTC*` on a
  midnight-UTC-anchored `Date`, never epoch or local-time arithmetic — so
  a day is always a day, regardless of what a real DST transition would
  do to elapsed milliseconds.
- The ICS feed's `VTIMEZONE` carries real CET/CEST rules, so a
  subscriber's calendar app renders correct local times year-round even
  though the app itself never thinks about DST.

## Quick reference: which value do I want?

| I need... | Use |
|---|---|
| Compare "now" against a class/special/event time | `clock.posterMinutes` vs `toPosterMinutes(x)` |
| The poster currently in force (for `classesOn`, `dailyFor`, etc.) | `clock.posterDate` |
| "What calendar day is it" for display | `clock.dateISO` |
| Day/night ground theme | `clock.minutes` via `isNightGround` |
| Step or diff `YYYY-MM-DD` strings | `addDays`/`diffDays` from `src/lib/dates.ts` |
